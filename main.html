  <h1>History</h1>
  <p class="main-articles"><strong>Main articles:</strong> History of blogging and online diary</p>

  <p>
    An early example of a "diary" style blog consisting of text and images transmitted wirelessly in real-time 
    from a wearable computer with head-up display, February 22, 1995. The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger 
    on December 17, 1997. The short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog 
    into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999. Shortly thereafter, Evan 
    Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit ones weblog or to post 
    to ones weblog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs Blogger product, leading to the 
    popularization of the terms.[17]

  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>
    Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including Usenet, commercial online 
    services such as GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail lists,[18] and 
    Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).
